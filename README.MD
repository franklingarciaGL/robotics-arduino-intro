# Introduction to Robotics with Arduino

The present repository, contains examples and exercices with its solutions, to introduce robotics concepts using Arduino as electrnics platform.

## Examples

### Sensor (ultrasonic)

Using a ultrasonic sensor, based on the distance, the example prints the calculated distance in centimeters.

### Light Sensor (ultrasonic)
Using a ultrasonic sensor, based on the distance, we can control the color and intensity of a LED.

### Servo with Sensor (ultrasonic)

Using a ultrasonic sensor, based on the distance, we can activate a servo motor to react to a specific distance range.

### Police Lights
Just an example of how to play with LEDs

### Robotkit
Using an S4A Edu board with Robotkit library, an easier way to program robots.
